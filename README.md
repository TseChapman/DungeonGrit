# Game Overview
Dungeon Grit will be a 2D side-scrolling dungeon escape game.  Players will begin trapped on the bottom floor of a multi-level dungeon where they must fight various monsters and bosses to advance to higher levels and eventually escape.

The player hero has 1 life only.  If they die, they are knocked unconscious and awaken back on the bottom floor of the dungeon.  Health potions that drop from monsters can help keep a player topped off as they progress up the dungeon.  Along the way the player will have the option of upgrading their weapon based on drops from monster and boss kills.  We might also include gold drops from monsters that a player can use to buy various useful items at dungeon checkpoints.

Players are limited to just a few actions:  move forwards, move backwards, jump, shield, and attack.  Crouch and dodge are stretch goal movements we would like to add.  Monsters will move along set patrol paths until they come in close proximity with the player’s hero.  Once a hero is targeted by a monster it will move as close as it needs to to begin attacking, either via a melee or ranged attack.  We will have a variety of monsters, varying in health and attack type.

Players will not be able to interact with terrain other than moving across it or jumping on top of it.  We have a stretch goal of making some terrain pieces interactable so that we might be able to introduce a puzzle solving aspect to the game.  A stretch goal we have to give the game some verticality by hiding treasures in non-obvious and difficult to reach places.  If we are able to add in interactable terrain, some of these areas might only be accessible by moving terrain around to get to otherwise unreachable places.  Other interacting terrain would possibly be traps that would hurt the player if they activate / don’t avoid the trap.

At the end of each dungeon level the player will have to fight a boss encounter.  The boss of each level will be based on the types of monsters the hero fought on that level.  The Goblin King is the boss of the goblin level, for example.  The health pool of the boss will be much larger than any of the other monsters and their attacks will be more punishing.  In some instances, player movement may be restricted by the environment around the boss.
